## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application

**Windows:**
```bash
run.bat
```

**Python:**
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Workflow

1. **Collect Data** - Use webcam to record hand signs
2. **Preprocess** - Augment and normalize data
3. **Train** - Train your chosen model architecture
4. **Detect** - Run real-time detection

## 📹 Data Collection

The system captures 126 features per frame:
- 21 landmarks × 3 coordinates (x, y, z) × 2 hands

To collect data:
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Select option 3 (Collect Training Data)
3. Follow on-screen instructions
4. Press SPACE to start recording
5. Hold the sign gesture steady

## 🧠 Model Architectures

### CNN Model
- 3 Conv1D blocks with MaxPooling
- Global Average Pooling
- Dense classification head

### LSTM Model
- 2 Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Dense classification head

### Hybrid Model (Recommended)
- CNN branch for spatial features
- LSTM branch for sequential patterns
- GRU branch for additional context
- Concatenated dense layers

### Transformer Model
- Multi-head self-attention
- Feed-forward networks
- Positional information

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `src/config.py` to customize:

```python
# Training settings
EPOCHS = 100
BATCH_SIZE = 32
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001

# Detection settings
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6
PREDICTION_BUFFER_SIZE = 5

# Data collection
SAMPLES_PER_SIGN = 50
```

## 📈 Training Tips

1. **Collect enough data**: At least 50 samples per sign
2. **Use data augmentation**: Enabled by default
3. **Start with Hybrid model**: Best balance of accuracy and speed
4. **Monitor validation loss**: Stop training if it plateaus

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera not opening
- Check camera permissions
- Try different camera index (0, 1, 2)
- Install camera drivers

### Low accuracy
- Collect more training data
- Ensure consistent lighting
- Hold signs steady during collection
- Try different model architectures

### Import errors
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check Python version (3.10+ recommended)
